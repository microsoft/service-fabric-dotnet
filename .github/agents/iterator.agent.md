**Understand `.github/copilot-instructions.md` before doing anything else**.
This repository requires unique knowledge you don't possess; you won't know what you don't know until you read them.

1. **Run the `coder` subagent to write code if doesn't exist yet**
  - _If the code exists, skip to step 2_. It's `reviewer`'s job to decide if the code is good enough.
  - Use this template for the `coder` prompt
    ```md
    Implement `{what is needed?}`.
    Note that I'm working on the following request.
    ---
    {your prompt}
    ---
    ```
    - Don't explain how to implement the code, file names or paths.
    - Don't mention git.
    - Don't mention, summarize or synthesize `*.instructions.md` files.
    - Don't change the prompt in any other way.
  - After the `coder` is done, proceed to step 2 of the iteration loop.

2. **Prepare prompt for the `reviewer`**.
  - Extract a file path to be reviewed from your prompt.
  - Use this prompt template; replace the `{file path}` and `{your prompt}` placeholders.
    ```md
    Execute /review skill with argument `{file path}`.
    - _Avoid contradicting findings resolved by prior commits in `git log origin/HEAD..HEAD -- {file path}`_.
      A contradicting finding must be described in detail in a commit messages. A code change alone is not a contradiction.
    - _Exclude findings previously reported in `{file path}-needs-human-review.md`, if it exists_.

    Note that I'm working on the following request.
    ---
    {your prompt}
    ---
    ```
  - Do not change the reviewer prompt in any other way.

3. **Implement human decisions before reviewing again.**.
  - Read `{file path}-needs-human-review.md`. It may have been created by past iterations or agent sessions.
  - For each finding that has a human decision, one at a time:
    - Extract a single finding, including notes from authors, other models, and human decision.
    - Run the `coder` subagent as described in step 5 for the finding you extracted.
    - Remove the addressed finding from the file.
  - Remove the file if all findings have been removed.

4. **Run the `reviewer` subagent with the prepared prompt**.
  - Do not change the prepared review prompt.

5. **Address `❗ Must Fix` and `⚠️ Should Fix` findings one at a time**.
  - Don't bundle multiple findings into a single `coder` invocation, even if they apply to the same file.
  - Prepare prompt for the `coder`.
    - Start the prompt with `Address the following finding.`
    - Append a single reported finding from the report. Don't alter the finding in any way.
    - Don't change this prompt in any other way, in particular:
      - don't add any commit instructions.
  - Run the `coder` subagent with the prepared prompt.
  - Wait for it to complete before starting the next.
  - If the `coder` refuses to implement the finding, save it as described in step 6 and continue addressing others.

6. **Save each new finding that `❓ Needs Human Review`**.
  - Append the entire finding from the `reviewer` report to the `{file path}-needs-human-review.md`.

7. **Repeat from step 3 (implement human decisions) until step 4 (review) produces no new findings**.

8. **Return the final review output verbatim**.
