- **Understand `.github/copilot-instructions.md` before doing anything else**.
  This repository requires unique knowledge you don't possess; you won't know what you don't know until you read them.

- **Don't review the code yourself** - only prepare prompts, start subagents, and synthesize their reports.
  - Don't read source to form your own findings.
  - Don't add or remove findings.
  - Don't change a finding's severity except via the synthesis mechanics below.

- **Prepare the review prompt for subagents**.
  - Take your own prompt, verbatim.
  - Append `Don't start the "reviewer" subagent.`
  - Don't change the prompt in any other way.

- **Run, one at a time, subagents `gemini`, `gpt` and `opus`, with the prepared prompt**.
  - Don't change the prepared prompt in any way - each subagent needs to perform a complete, independent review.
  - Wait for each agent to complete before starting another.

- **Prepare the cross-check prompt**.
  - Start with the following template.
    > Independently assess the following findings raised by another reviewer. Do not assume the original finding is correct.
    > For each finding, read the cited code and applicable `.instructions.md` rules, state your reasoning, cite evidence,
    > and conclude with `Agree`, `Disagree` or `Abstain` if you're not confident.
    > Note that I'm working on the following request.
    > ```
    > {your prompt}
    > ```
  - If your input prompt overrides the location of the `.instructions.md` files, add it to the cross-check prompt too.

- **Deduplicate findings raised independently by multiple models**.
  - Retain information about models that reported each issue for the cross-check and the final report.

- **Cross-check every finding that lacks unanimous support**.
  - Don't cross-check `📝 Notes` unless they contradict recommendations from other models.
  - A finding requires cross-check if **any** of the three models explicitly contradicted or did not report it.
  - Run, in parallel, subagents of every model that contradicted or did not report the finding, with the cross-check prompt.
    For example, if `gemini` and `gpt` reported a finding and `opus` did not, ask `opus` to cross-check it.
  - Record each cross-check verdict verbatim (`Agree`, `Disagree`, `Abstain`) alongside the model name.

- **Incorporate the cross-check feedback**.
  Repeat for every finding that received `Disagree` votes during cross-check:
  - Prepare the feedback prompt
    ```md
    Re-evaluate your previous recommendation taking into account responses from other models.

    {Original Finding}
    {Cross-check Responses}
    ---
    Note that I'm working on the following request.
    ---
    {your prompt}
    ---
    Respond with
    - `Insist` if you still believe your original proposal should be implemented.
    - `Retract` if you now believe your original proposal is incorrect or optional.
    Include detailed justification.
    ```
    - Don't change the prompt in any other way
  - Run subagents of the models that reported the finding with the feedback prompt.
  - Record each `Insist`/`Retract` response verbatim.

- **Double-check every finding insisted upon by the author after the cross-check feedback**
  Repeat for every finding that authors `Insist` on after cross-check.
  - Prepare the double-check prompt
    ```md
    Respond to the finding author insisting on it after you disagreed.

    Note that I'm working on the following request.
    ---
    {your prompt}
    ---
    Respond with
    - `Agree` if you now agree with the finding.
    - `Accept` if you accept it as an alternative solution for a problem that could be solved either way.
    - `Reject` if you still believe author's proposal shouldn't be implemented.
    Include detailed justification.
    ```
  - Run subagents of the models that disagreed with the double-check prompt.

- **Synthesize the combined report**.
  - Derive every finding's severity only from the mechanics below.
  - Don't add, drop, or downgrade findings on your own judgment.
  - Drop findings authors decided to `Retract` after the cross-check feedback.
  - Change findings others decided to `Reject` after the double-check to `❓ Needs Human Review`.
  - Retain at the severity reported by the author for findings others decided to `Accept` after the double-check.
  - Elevate `💡 Suggestions` reported or voted `Agree` by multiple models to `⚠️ Should Fix`.
  - Follow the report format defined in `review/SKILL.md` (Verdict, Detailed Assessment, Issues).
  - Finding format:
    - Prefix the finding title with the severity synthesized by the cross-check.
    - Include complete finding reports from authors, cross-check responses, and authors' response to cross-check.
