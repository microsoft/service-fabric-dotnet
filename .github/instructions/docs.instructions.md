  Instructions in this file are incomplete without them.

# Documentation guidance

- Write for intermediate to advanced C# developers.
- Write documentation for the users, not the maintainers.
- Make documentation as concise as possible without losing information.
- Change phrasing to drop redundant words, for example `Returns red apples.` over `Returns apples of red color.`
- Focus on the "why". The "how" should be self-explanatory from the API itself.
- Always try to simplify APIs before resorting to documenting them.

## NuGet packages

### Description (.csproj)

- Start with what the package provides, not "This package contains...".
- Keep it to one sentence — NuGet.org truncates long descriptions in search results.

### README.md

- Use the package ID as the heading.
- Structure: purpose, key types, usage example, documentation links.
- Keep examples minimal — just enough to show how to get started.
- Mark internal packages (`*.Internal`) as not intended for direct consumption.

## C# XML comments

- Document `public` and `protected` members with [XML comments](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments).
- Document internal members only if they are complex or not self-explanatory.
- Verify XML comments by building the project before committing changes.
- When removing unnecessary XML comments, preserve significant information as regular comments.
- Use `<summary>` to provide a brief description of what the type or member does. Start the summary with a present-tense, third-person verb.
- Use `<remarks>` for additional information, such as usage notes relevant to consumers.
  - Remove `<remarks>` if it restates documented-elsewhere or self-evident information. This is an optional element.
  - Don't document implementation details of the API not relevant to consumers of the library.
  - Don't document inheritor instructions for APIs not meant to be extended by consumers of the library.
- Use `<see langword="..."/>` for language-specific keywords like `null`, `true`, `false`, `int`, `bool`, etc.
- Use `<c>` for inline code snippets.
- Use `<example>` for usage examples on how to use the member.
  - Use `<code>` for code blocks. `<code>` tags should be placed within an `<example>` tag.
    Add the language of the code example using the `language` attribute, for example, `<code language="csharp">`.
- Use `<see cref="..."/>` to reference other types or members inline (in a sentence).
- Use `<seealso cref="..."/>` for standalone (not in a sentence) references to other types or members in the "See also" section of the online docs.
- Reuse documentation from other types and members to keep duplication to a minimum.
  - Use `<inheritdoc/>` for interface implementations and overrides unless there is a major behavior change.
  - Use `<inheritdoc cref="..."/>` to reuse documentation from related types, like the base type, and members, like method overloads.
  - When referenced documentation cannot be reused in its entirety, specify `path`.
    - Place `path` before `cref` to make `<inheritdoc>` more readable when mixed with regular elements.
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/summary" cref="..."/>` to reuse `<summary>`.
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/remarks" cref="..."/>` to reuse `<remarks>`.
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/param']" cref="..."/>` to reuse all `<param>` elements.
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/param[@name='{name}']" cref="..."/>` to reuse a specific `<param name="{name}">`.
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/typeparam" cref="..."/>` to reuse all `<typeparam>` elements.
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/typeparam[@name='{name}']" cref="..."/>` to reuse a specific `<typeparam name="{name}">`
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/exception']" cref="..."/>` to reuse all `<exception>` elements.
    - Use `<inheritdoc path="/exception[@cref='T:{FullName}']" cref="..."/>` to reuse a specific `<exception cref="{Name}">`.
  - Apply object-oriented design to documentation inheritance:
    - Reuse more generic documentation, e.g.
      - Document base classes and reuse their docs in derived classes.
      - Document interfaces and reuse their docs in implementors.
      - Document methods with the most parameters and reuse their docs in overloads/extensions that reduce the parameter set.
    - If behavior doesn't apply to every inheritor, don't document it in the base/provider.
  - Document differences instead of using `<inheritdoc/>` when there is a major behavior change.
- Use `<para>` when multiple paragraphs are needed to make a documentation section readable.
  - Never use `<para>` in single-paragraph sections.
- For generic overloads, don't add "strongly-typed" or similar qualifiers to distinguish them from non-generic overloads. Let the type parameter references speak for themselves.
- _Prefer short type names in the `cref="..."` references_. 
  - Avoid fully-qualified references, e.g. `<seealso cref="Fully.Qualified.Foo"/>`.
  - If the type's namespace is not imported, add a `using` directive, e.g. `using Fully.Qualified; /// <seealso cref="Foo"/>`
  - If the type name appears in multiple imported namespaces, but used only from one, add an alias to disambiguate, e.g.
    `using Foo = Fully.Qualified.Foo; /// <seealso cref="Foo"/>`.
  - If the type is an open generic and cannot be aliased, use the shortest qualification needed to disambiguate, e.g.
    `using Fully; /// <seealso cref="Qualified.Foo{T}"/>`
- _Prefer `<see cref="..."/>` over plain text when referring to domain concepts with first-class abstractions_.
  E.g. `Sets the specified <see cref="Transaction"/> as the ambient transaction`. The first reference becomes a hyperlink
  users can follow, while the subsequent mentions remain plain text to keep the docs easy to read.

### Methods

- Use `<summary>` to describe _what_ the method does, not _how_ it is implemented.
  - For methods that return a value
    - Use template `{what it does} and returns {what it returns}`. E.g. `Foo.TryParse(string s, out Foo result)` summary should be
      ```xml
      Tries to parse <paramref name="s"/> into a <see cref="Foo"/> <paramref name="result"/> and returns <see langword="true"/>
      if it was successfully parsed; otherwise returns <see langword="false"/>.
      ```
    - For methods where action and result are logically the same, use template `Returns {what it returns}`.
      E.g. `Foo.Parse(string s)` summary should be
      ```xml
      Returns a <see cref="Foo"/> object parsed from the string representation in <paramref name="s"/>.
      ```
  - For methods returning `Task` or `Task<T>`:
    - Start `<summary>` with `Asynchronously`, followed by _a present-tense, third-person verb_ as described above.
    - Don't describe non-generic `Task` results - such methods are asynchronous `void` equivalents.
    - Describe `T` instead of `Task<T>` results - such methods are asynchronous value-returning equivalents.
- Use `<returns>` to describe what the method returns, but only if it's not redundant.
  - Remove `<returns>` if it restates documented-elsewhere or self-evident information. This is an optional element.
  - Try improving the method name and return type before documenting it.
  - The description should be a noun phrase that doesn't specify the data type.
  - Begin with an introductory article.
  - If the return type is Boolean, the wording should be of the form "`<see langword="true" />` if ...; otherwise, `<see langword="false" />`.".

### Parameters

- Remove `<param>` elements that restate information evident from the parameter types and names.
  This is an optional element, but if one parameter is needs docs, C# compiler requires them for all parameters.
- Improve parameter types and names before documenting them.
- Use `<param name="...">` to describe method parameters.
  - The description should be a noun phrase that doesn't specify the data type.
  - Begin with an introductory article.
  - If the parameter is a flag enum, start the description with "A bitwise combination of the enumeration values that specifies...".
  - If the parameter is a non-flag enum, start the description with "One of the enumeration values that specifies...".
  - If the parameter is a Boolean, the wording should be of the form "`<see langword="true" />` to ...; otherwise, `<see langword="false" />`.".
  - If the parameter is an "out" parameter, the wording should be of the form
    `When this method returns, contains .... This parameter is treated as uninitialized.`.
- Use `<paramref name="...">` to reference parameter names in documentation.

### Type Parameters

- Use `<typeparam name="...">` to describe type parameters in generic types or methods, but only if they're not redundant.
  - Remove all `<typeparam>` elements if they restate documented-elsewhere or self-evident information. This is an optional
- Use `<typeparamref name="...">` to reference type parameters in documentation.

### Constructors

- The summary wording should be "Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="..."/> class (or struct).".
- Don't create default constructors just to document them.

### Properties

- The `<summary>` should start with:
  - "Gets or sets..." for a read-write property.
  - "Gets..." for a read-only property.
  - "Sets..." for a set-only property.
  - "Gets [or sets] a value that indicates whether..." for properties that return a Boolean value.
- Use `<value>` to describe the value of the property, but only if it's not redundant.
  - Remove `<value>` if it restates documented-elsewhere or self-evident information. This is an optional element.
  - The description should be a noun phrase that doesn't specify the data type.
  - If the property has a default value, add it in a separate sentence, for example, "The default is `<see langword="false" />`".
  - If the value type is Boolean, the wording should be of the form "`<see langword="true" />` if ...; otherwise, `<see langword="false" />`. The default is ...".

### Events

- The `<summary>` should start with "Occurs when...".

### Exceptions

- Use `<exception cref="...">` to document exceptions thrown by constructors, properties, indexers, methods, operators, and events.
- Document all exceptions thrown directly by the member.
- For exceptions thrown by the callees of the member
  - Document the API-level exceptions users are likely to encounter. E.g. a member passing an argument to a callee that
    validates it and throws `ArgumentNullException` should have it documented.
  - Don't document the low-level implementation exceptions that can be thrown by callees. E.g. don't document `ArithmeticException`
    or its descendants.
  - Create `// TODO: <exception cref="{ExpectedException}">...</exception>` for missing validations that allow low-level
    exceptions to escape.
- Sort exception elements _alphabetically_ to reduce future merge conflicts.
  Ideally, each exception doc fits on a single line so users can re-sort them quickly using their editor.
  - Place `<exception cref="...">` elements first.
  - Place `<inheritdoc path="/exception...']"/>` elements below.
- Don't document exceptions without evidence they're are actually thrown. Symmetry with other APIs is irrelevant and doesn't
  justify lack of evidence.
- Describe the condition under which it's thrown.
  - Omit "Thrown if ..." or "If ..." at the beginning of the sentence.
