- **Read the `copilot-instructions.md` first**.
  Instructions in this file are incomplete without them.

# Understand Project Context

- Find and read the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files closest to the files being modified or reviewed.
- Walk up from the file's directory to the repository root, stopping at the first match for each.

# Capture Insights from Feedback

After applying any change requested through feedback, check whether the feedback contains a reusable insight before responding.
This is a required final step, not a background task.

1. Scan the user's message for signal phrases: `note`, `always`, `never`, `make sure`, `you should've`, `why didn't you`, or repeated corrections of the same kind.
2. If a reusable guideline is present, update the appropriate `.md` file as part of the same response — don't defer it.
3. Don't codify trivial one-off corrections, only high-confidence insights.
4. Ask for clarification and confirmation when in doubt.

# Organize Knowledge for Humans

- Your audience is experienced engineers. Don't restate the obvious.
- Avoid duplicating information readily available from the source code.
- Store information in the most specific `.md` files possible. Elevate it to more general `.md` files only when clearly applicable to a broader scope.
- Store human-readable insights and guidelines in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` files.
  - Place repository-wide content in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root directory.
  - When repository contains multiple product projects (as opposed to test or example projects), place project-specific content in the project directory.
- Store instructions applicable across multiple repositories, such as coding style, methodology, etc. in the `.instructions.md` files.
- Never use memory files (`/memories/`). You're helping teams, not individuals. Store insights in `.instructions.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `README.md` files instead.
- Keep `.instructions.md` files focused on specific topics.
- When a language-specific `.instructions.md` file specializes a more general one, preserve the matching section structure so humans can see the relationship.
- When an `.instructions.md` file grows beyond ~250 lines, split it by topic.
- Name `.instructions.md` files after the topic they cover, e.g., `moq.instructions.md`.
- Each `.instructions.md` file should have YAML frontmatter with an `applyTo` pattern scoping it to relevant files.
- Check `.md` files for accuracy and redundancy during code reviews.
- Avoid markdown tables because they are difficult to maintain and read as plain text.

# Checklist

- When adding code or content check if it already exists elsewhere, and extract it into a shared location instead of copying it.
- Update `.md` files when modifying code artifacts referenced in them, such as functions, classes, packages, etc.
